hi pls read this 
When I play ponytown, I see people around me 
who use my shading style without permission,
or even copy and use my anxiety and
party noob joke skins. This is really
bothering me, please stop I always give you 
permission to take inspo, but without permission
it really annoys me I'm not saying that
my skin is more beautiful and interesting than
anyone else's, but anyway, anyone in my place
feels this bad feeling. Please don't be shy
to ask questions for inspo.
